Ver 1.1 
Date 3/3/2024
- Started and finished pympis REBORN.
- Added new commands like the csgo smoke command, the league related commands, as well as requested changes to old commands
- A lot of the changes done here were to make the bot more uniform and less monkey coded
    - This was done by actually organizing the files
    - Putting code into cogs and separating them into multiple files
    - Creating more readable and neater code, with more helpful comments.
    - Used csv files and outside data sources to make it easier to add / update the bot without touching the source code as often. 
- I also swapped from using normal commands to supported slash commands, this has some benefits as well as downsides
- Overall the bot is more supported by discord, more properly coded, and more secure for its future.
